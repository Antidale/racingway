# Commands
## !flags $your_flagstring
The flags command currently rolls seeds off of Galeswift's fork of Free Enterprise. Support for selecting whether you want flags from the main site or Galeswift's fork is coming soon.

## !preset $preset_name
Not yet implemented, but will allow you to roll from a curated list of flagsets. Also coming soon.

Racingway built with the [racetime-bot](https://github.com/racetimeGG/racetime-bot) and is initially patterned after [ootr-randobot](https://github.com/OoTRandomizer/rtgg-randobot). Seed generation code initially patterned after Yanguin8r's code for the same.
