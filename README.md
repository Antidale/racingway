Racingway is a [racetime.gg](https://racetime.gg) category bot for [Free Enterprise](https://ff4fe.com/make). If you'd like to help contribute, or have suggestions, hop in the [Tellah's Library](https://discord.gg/x95jN69Ggf) discord server.

# Commands
## !preset 
Right now, the !preset command is set up to generate seeds for a flagset that's under consideration for a future tournament. Other presets will be added in the near future.

## !seed
The !seed command generates a random alphanumeric string that is 10 characters in length, so that people looking to race can have confidence that nobody is pre-generating a seed that they've already run and linking to that. Once more generalized flagset/preset support has been added, this command will be retired.

Racingway built with the [racetime-bot](https://github.com/racetimeGG/racetime-bot) and is initially patterned after [ootr-randobot](https://github.com/OoTRandomizer/rtgg-randobot).
